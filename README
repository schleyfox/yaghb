Damn simple github badge script.

So github badge bling is kind of the thing to have these days.
Dr. Nic makes an amazing JS badge that is basically awesome.
Unfortunately it hates konqueror, IE6, and my typo blog layout.
To remedy this, I made my own simple github api massager.
The result is yet-another-github-badge, which is a php script that creates
javascript that will bling out a list of your projects.

To use it put the following into the sidebar part of your blag.

  <ul id="yaghb"></ul>
  <script src="http://ben.pixelmachine.org/yaghb.php?username=USERNAME" />

If you want, you can take yaghb and drop it on your own server and modify how
it outputs the list.

You can see this in action at http://ben.pixelmachine.org under the Projects
heading
